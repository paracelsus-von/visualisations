Ideas:

Base: Map. Mercator Projection
Animation: Over time, in years
Timescale: time speeds up between periods of no info/few deaths (i.e 100BC to 1800)
time slows down rapidly in 20th century
Markers: Circles, area (NOT DIAMETER) represents death toll
Duration of markers: Time-step between years is relative to number of deaths that years
Growth of markers: Marker does normal animation if deaths occurred in one year
                   if deaths occurred over multiple years, markers start at 10% and grow till 100% in final year.
